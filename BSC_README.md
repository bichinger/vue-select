## How to Build dist?
To provide a refreshed distribution version, it must be built after changes in source code were made.
To build the dist version, open a shell, go to project root and execute:
 ```bash
 $ npm run-script build
 ```
or alternatively:
```bash
 $ yarn run build
 ```
It will build .js and .map files which can then be committed.
